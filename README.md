# FORM MADE SEXY WITH CSS ONLY (No bootstrap-cheating)

You can sign up through the form and will then be redirected to a logged_in page, that has basically no interest except showing that a beginning of CRUD has been made and the app is functioning.

The goal of the exercice simply was to make a sexy-shiny form with CSS ðŸ’ƒ

## The original

The sign-up form was based on this one: https://dribbble.com/shots/2008170-Uniform-Login
